This may be children playing at play grounds or homeless people, who find it diffiult to meet basic neccessities. Keeping this in mind, the high the number of drinking fountain, the better the neighborhood.\n",

However, researching online n its safety standards i think it is a good plae to live. However, as I am currently in Oakland, I'll prefer here since I consider it to be relatively safe as nothing dangerous has happened in my three months of being here."
