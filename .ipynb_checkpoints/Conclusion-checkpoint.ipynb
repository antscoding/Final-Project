    "### I used the Pittsburgh Firearm Seizure dataset from WPRDC to measure safety by counting firearm seizures per neighborhood. I cleaned the data, counted incidents, normalized the values, and inverted them so neighborhoods with fewer firearm seizures received higher “safety” scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Firearm seizure activity is a good indicator of serious criminal behavior and police activity. Fewer firearm seizures suggest safer conditions and contribute to the definition of the “best” neighborhood. However, this data can be influenced by policing patterns; neighborhoods with more police presence may report more seizures even if crime is not actually higher.\n",
